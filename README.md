# My Snake Game!
In this project I decided to build the well known snake game using react.

## The Game's goal
Eat all the apples that spawns in the board.

## The Game's Rules
1) Don't cross the boarders of the screen - if the snake crosses it the game is over.
2) Don't bite yourself - if the snake's head bites his own body the game is over.


## How To Play
To start the play just press enter on your keyboard.

There are two defined ways to control the snake movment:

* the "W S A D" keys:
  * W - go up.
  * S - go down.
  * A - go left.
  * D - go right.
* the keyboard arrows.

_important! the snake can't turn to the opposite direction, for example if the snake is going up, you can't make him go down._

### Restarting the game
If you failed to collect all the apples and striked out, there will be a pop up at the end of the game which allows you to restart a new game.


## To Do Next
- [ ] Add support for mobile devices
- [ ] Add a local leader board
